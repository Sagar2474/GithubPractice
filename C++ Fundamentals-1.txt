Basic Structure of C++ program

#include<iostream>
using namespace std:
int main()
{
 std:cout << "Hello World";
 return 0;
}

Step by Step Analyzation 

#(directive)- It is processed by preprocessor which is the program invoked by compiler.

Note: Preprocessor- Program that processes our source code before compilation

#include - It tells compiler to include a file

#include<iostream> - It tells compiler to include standard input and output file

using namespace std: - It is used to import all the type of namespace (defination) into current namespace of program. It consists of hundreds of predefined identifers.

int main() : It is used to declare function named 'main' under the integer type. Every C/C++ program must have main function. It must be enclosed with {}

Note: void main() must be avoided in the program as the compiler may throw garbage value.

return 0 - It is used to return the value of the function. It indicates finishing of function. If return 0 is not written in the program, the program returns integer value 0 in the case of successful execution.
